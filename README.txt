To run the application do the following:

1.Copy FTPManager folder to C: drive.
2.Open Server folder and double click server.bat file.
3.When prompt opens click OK to start registry and server on default port 1099.
4.Once confirmation that Server is ready is shown - Open client folder.
5.Double click client.bat file - follow on screen instructions.
6.To run more clients concurrently double click client.bat file - assuming a server is running.


NOTE: !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Due to permissions and security issues some folders are inaccessible for uploading.
I have found it easier for testing to copy a variety of files(text,word,pictures,music,video) 
to the Desktop or Documents folders and use these.

This was a bigger problem on the PC's in ITTralee and no issues arose on personal machine.
